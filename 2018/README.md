## Theme

### Sahara Marketplace

Building the [Sahara Marketplace](./sahara), Africa’s Green Marketplace.

The platform will include 4 modules, each will be developed both for web/app and for mobile/USSD. Each team will have experts and frameworks, teams will work together to build the module and integrate it with the platform. Below is a brief description of what every team will do.

* ``Authentication team`` : Create a blockchain powered authentication module (self sovereign identity) that can be used to identify and authenticate any user of the platform, and can be used on different platforms that implement the ``Sahara ID``.

* ``Company team`` : Allow a company, entity or institution profile to be created with specific authorisation based on their role on the platform

* ``Campaign team`` : Allow an entity to create a project profile to request specific actions from the platform community members. ``Use case``: the restoration of Nyandungu Park, involving the Rwandan Ministry of Environment and local citizens

* ``Payment team`` : Allow any user of the platform to create and maintain a wallet that will allow them to support specific campaigns or buy items on the platform. ``Use case`` : Sponsoring a project from the Rwandan Ministry of environment

The authentication, company and payment teams will be using existing open-source protocols, while the campaign/community team will be creating a new ``umuganda 2.0`` community protocol.
