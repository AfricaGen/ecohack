# Sahara Marketplace Executive Summary

The Sahara marketplace (or platform) is a collaborative platform to mobilize resources for
agricultural development and ecosystem resilience projects in Africa.
Powered by blockchain technology, the Sahara Marketplace provides a one-stop center for
the creation, validation, financing and monitoring of agricultural and ecosystem projects
throughout Africa.

Farmers, entrepreneurs, organisations, scientists and volunteers around the continent will
benefit from a platform to raise funds for agriculture projects, or activities to restore
Africa’s degraded landscapes, and in the process transform millions of lives around the
continent.

The Sahara marketplace will allow financing through CDM carbon credits, voluntary carbon
credits, community fund-raising, and ecosystem services.

Africa has 60% of the world’s unexploited arable land, the most growth potential in
agriculture and the best opportunity in the world to sequester carbon.

Individuals, companies and institutions around the world are able to buy carbon credits,
which in turn allows people residing around the Sahara to sequester more.

Blockchain technology presents a number of advantages for the financing of projects in
Africa: instant, zero-fee transfer of project financing; immutable records; transparency;
easy monitoring and more.

The Sahara marketplace introduces an integrated platform for individuals, cooperatives,
private companies and institutions to finance ecosystem and agricultural projects with
ease. Projects that meet the criteria for a specific form of financing will receive funds
directly to their mobile money account or bank account.

In collaboration with local microfinance initiatives, promising projects will be able to
leverage the opportunity to obtaining upfront financing for carbon credits.
