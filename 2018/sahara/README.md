# Sahara Marketplace

The Sahara marketplace (or platform) is a collaborative platform to mobilize resources for
agricultural development and ecosystem resilience projects in Africa.
Powered by blockchain technology, the Sahara Marketplace provides a one-stop center for
the creation, validation, financing and monitoring of agricultural and ecosystem projects
throughout Africa.

Here is the detailed [Executive Summary](./executive_summary.md) of the Sahara Marketplace

## Goals

* Galvanize an African community of programmers, entrepreneurs and content creators that support the Sahara Marketplace through hackathons, online collaboration and ground activities.

* Build a globally accessible open-source blockchain platform to tokenize carbon credits for Africa.

* Develop a mobile application that allows communities across Africa to easily create projects that can be sponsored, joined, tailored, monitored, and much more.

* Create the platform for the commercialization of Sahara marketplace products such as: fruits, honey, arts and crafts that are produced from projects sponsored throughout Africa.

* Through the Sahara Marketplace social media channels, share and disseminate inspiring stories from across the continent regarding agriculture and conservation techniques for planting, maintaining and processing a variety of tree and plant species.

## Validation Use Case

The platform will include 4 modules, each will be developed both for web/app and for mobile/USSD. Each team will have experts and frameworks, teams will work together to build the module and integrate it with the platform. Below is a brief description of what every team will do.

* ``Authentication team`` : Create a blockchain powered authentication module (self sovereign identity) that can be used to identify and authenticate any user of the platform, and can be used on different platforms that implement the ``Sahara ID``.

* ``Company team`` : Allow a company, entity or institution profile to be created with specific authorisation based on their role on the platform

* ``Campaign team`` : Allow an entity to create a project profile to request specific actions from the platform community members. ``Use case``: the restoration of Nyandungu Park, involving the Rwandan Ministry of Environment and local citizens

* ``Payment team`` : Allow any user of the platform to create and maintain a wallet that will allow them to support specific campaigns or buy items on the platform. ``Use case`` : Sponsoring a project from the Rwandan Ministry of environment

The authentication, company and payment teams will be using existing open-source protocols, while the campaign/community team will be creating a new ``umuganda 2.0`` community protocol.
