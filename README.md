# EcoHack Africa

The EcoHack Africa is the premiere blockchain hackathon in Africa! It bring young programmers and entrepreneurs together with regulators and scholars for a Hackathon dedicated to building an open-source blockchain platform for the green economy in Africa.

EcoHack Africa is a “building hackathon”, meaning participants will work together to build an open-source platform that will be maintained by the community, and on top of which they can build their own application.

## Goal

We aim to mobilize 1 million Africans through hackathons, open-source projects and crowdsourcing to solve some of Africa’s most complex challenges.
